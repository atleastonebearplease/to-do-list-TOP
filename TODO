Model:
  Node:
    ☐ Create the TreeNode and TreeService
      ☐ Now add the findNode(predicate) function
        This finds a node based on a call back function that tests for a condition (depth first recursively)
        and return the node. Used for finding by title, due date, completed items, etc.
      ☐ Now add removeNode(root, predicate) function
      ☐ Add removeNodeByID(root, ID) function
        Recursively check for the first match and splice it out of the root's children array (ChatGPT)
      ☐ Consider adding a map function to perform operations on it (such as saving the whole tree?)

  Task: 
    ☐ Get the Task to be serializable
      ☐ Create the Serializable object (where you'll implement the save and load functions for each Serializable);
      ☐ Implement a function to write a task to local storage
      ☐ Implement a functin to read a task from local storage 
      ☐ Extract these into TaskLoader
      ☐ Do the same, but for a whole project. ProjectLoader

View:
☐ Implement project sidebar with live projects
  ☐ The projects sub-headings need to be based on the sections/headings in the main
☐ Implement the ability to add a description
  This means that the task should expand below and allow editing of text
  Tasks:
    ☐ Make the tasks section a fixed width in the page
    ☐ Add the option to center it or to place it on the left side
    ☐ Make the delete button a trash can icon
    ☐ Add a divider between tasks
    ☐ Add a checkbox to the tasks


  Design and Style:
    ✔ Make the delete button only show upon hovering over the task @done(25-10-27 10:22)
    ☐ Fix the CSS to have background expand with the page - Grid or Flex?
    ☐ Project section on sidebar should stay in place
    ☐ Style the input to not be retarded

  DOM:
    ☐ Make DOM static

Controller:

  Task:
    ✔ The ability to select and focus a task @done(25-10-27 10:13)
    ☐ Create EventService to handle tasks
      For example, a TaskEvent handler. When there is a keydown event, say, we see what the currently active element is. If it's a task, we pass the task to the TaskEventHandler. If it's an AddTaskButton, we pass it to that handler. Etc.
      ☐ Create the TaskEventService
    ☐ The ability to make a task a sub-task with the tab key
      ✔ Get the Tab key hooked up to a listener in the Main class @done(25-10-27 17:07)
      ☐ Get the Tab key to make the TreeNode of the task jump down to a child of the one above it
      ☐ This should be in a "Task Event Handler" that is given the currently selected task when needed
      Since we're not doing mass operations on tasks, we can just create a new handler for each new task that is selected. Just creating the Handler only would require a DOM element; 
      the Node can be found when we do an operation
      ☐ Needs to check to make sure that there is a viable parent
      There can't be a subtask that is two levels below a parent. Each subtask's parent must be one level above it
    

    ☐ Select a task with the arrow keys (once one has already been selected)
    ☐ The last task in the last section should be focused upon page load
    ☐ Move tasks up and down with keyboard controls
    ☐ Drag and drop tasks to move them
    ☐ Add a confirmation if the task to be deleted contains subtasks (so that the user doesn't accidentally delete a shitload)
    ☐ Ability to check off tasks
  Events:
    ☐ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QdBHUfMLn31EnHHUrpzSZmKh0Dkc2n_tq0JXcHisb34/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.97xph2wj183t - How to handle event propagation with Event Handlers.
  
ACTIONS THIS COMMIT
-Make delete button only appear on hover of parent

Archive:
  ✔ Get the TreeNodes implemented in the Tasks @done(25-10-23 16:03) @project(Model)
  ✔ Add TreeNode to tasks @done(25-10-23 13:15) @project(Model)
  ✔ Add TreeNode data to actual Task definition @done(25-10-23 13:15) @project(Model)
    We are adding TreeNode so that we can begin to perform operations like removing and whatnot
  ✔ Now, we need to start operating from a Root node @done(25-10-23 16:03) @project(Model)
    Later this will be done in a Project class, but for now I think we should just put it in main and 'hardcode' it
  ✔ Add a root TreeNode to main @done(25-10-23 16:02) @project(Model)
  ✔ Now, when adding a task, set the task.node's parent to the 'root' node in main @done(25-10-23 16:02) @project(Model)
  ✔ Add reference to main section @done(25-10-23 13:04) @project(DOM)
  ✔ Make the AddTaskButton actually add an input, but not a new task yet @done(25-10-27 07:05) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Separate adding task functionality from InputHandler function into it's own in main @done(25-10-27 07:08) @project(Controller)
    The AddTaskButton should add an input that disapears when left empty, and adds a tasks when the enter key is pressed or the input is unfocused. This way we can add a cleaner add task function and use it for testing
  ✔ We need to be able to delete the Tasks @done(25-10-27 07:08) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Add a delete button to tasks (DOM); @done(25-10-24 05:37) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Move hanlding the 'blur' event into a different function, or add in separate IF statement for separate logic @done(25-10-24 05:42) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Hook them up to a function in Main for now @done(25-10-25 17:16) @project(Controller)
  ✔ The function should both remove the DOM and remove the TreeNode @done(25-10-25 17:16) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Need to add a remove TreeNode function to TreeService @done(25-10-25 17:16) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Start with just the TreeNode @done(25-10-21 16:30) @project(Model)
  ✔ Create the TreeService @done(25-10-21 16:30) @project(Model)
    This might just basically be what traverse is doing
  ✔ Create a bunch of Unique ToDo items so you can work on displaying items on screen @done(25-10-21 16:30) @project(Model)
  ✔ Change the element class names for the Tasks section to make more sense @done(25-10-23 13:03) @project(View)
  ✔ Add a DOM class @done(25-10-22 11:32) @project(View.DOM)
  ✔ Create a hook for the add task button in Main @done(25-10-21 16:30) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Make the button add a new to-do__item div to the page @done(25-10-21 16:30) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Should contain an input at first @done(25-10-22 11:19) @project(Controller)
  ✔ The input should be used to then change the task. When the input is changed (enter is pressed), then it should change the text of the parent to do element and then remove itself (the input) from the DOM. @done(25-10-22 11:19) @project(Controller)
  ✔ This also means that if the input is empty when the event fires, the whole To Do item should be removed. @done(25-10-22 11:31) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Made the add new task button actually add the input @done(25-10-22 11:32) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Create the Task class in separate module @done(25-10-16 11:03) @project(Model)
  ✔ Import it into the index and test it @done(25-10-16 11:03) @project(Model)
  ✔ Add functional date and time to completion for tasks @done(25-10-16 11:24) @project(Model)
  ✔ Research and test using the date functions @done(25-10-16 11:24) @project(Model)
  ✔ Just make the addChild function first and make sure it works @done(25-10-19 21:41) @project(Model)
  ✔ Then make the setRoot function and make sure that works @done(25-10-19 21:41) @project(Model)
  ✔ Make the Traverse(callback) function and make sure it works (can be used for printing for example) @done(25-10-19 22:06) @project(Model)
  ✔ To test, you can write a function to traverse the tree and print it out with indents (file tree style) @done(25-10-20 09:46) @project(Model)
  ✔ Now add the findByID(id) function @done(25-10-20 17:27) @project(Model)
  ✔ Create the IDService @done(25-10-18 16:24) @project(Model)
  ✔ Start with a simple, non hierarchical ID for tasks. Follow the diagram @done(25-10-16 11:53) @project(Model)
  ✔ Make hierarchical ID (No guardrails though) @done(25-10-16 11:53) @project(Model)
  ✔ Add projectIDs as well @done(25-10-18 16:12) @project(Model)
  ✔ Add function for getting the uniqueID (the last ID is the current object's ID) @done(25-10-18 16:24) @project(Model)
