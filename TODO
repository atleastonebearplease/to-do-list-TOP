Model:
  ✔ Create the Task class in separate module @done(25-10-16 11:03)
  ✔ Import it into the index and test it @done(25-10-16 11:03)

  ✔ Add functional date and time to completion for tasks @done(25-10-16 11:24)
    ✔ Research and test using the date functions @done(25-10-16 11:24)

  ☐ Create the IDService
    This is a static class that will produce IDs, hold the last ID made, and do operations
    on IDs that exist in the code base. We are looking for a hierarchical set of IDs so that we 
    can separate tasks and subtasks and empower us to do a cheap breadth first search
    ☐ Start with a simple, non hierarchical ID for tasks. Follow the diagram

View:
  ✔ Get the basic page layout setup - look to one of the other ToDo apps for inspiration @done(25-10-15 12:16)

        ✔ Just make a single project 'card' to start @done(25-10-15 12:12)
          This is because we will eventually have multiple projects here
  ✔ Rewatch the video on designing websites/programs and take notes @done(25-10-14 14:17)

  ☐ Create the ToDo items section wrapper that your code can latch on to
  
  ☐ Think about what the most prominent features should be and design around that.
    ☐ Use the elements described in the video to make something good.
