Next Up (Cross-domain):
  ☐ Drag and drop tasks to move them
    ✔ Create or update a small project (testing javascript) to test out the dragging API @done(25-11-25 15:30)
    ✔ Add the draggable attribute to all task elements @done(25-11-27 17:33)
    ✔ Create a "drag handle" that is position to the left side of the task. @done(25-11-28 10:48)
      It should make everything on the task visible like hovering does on the main part of the task
    ☐ Make all of the tasks droppable
      ☐ Add an event listener for dragover
      ☐ The event listener should check if the draggedover element is a task, and if so, call event.preventdefault
        Thus, the tasks are now droppable
    ☐ Create a handler for drag start
      ✔ Add the handler on click @done(25-11-28 12:22)
      ✔ Remove the handle on click release @done(25-11-29 10:46)
      ✔ Set the drag image to the whole .task @done(25-11-29 10:46)
      ✔ Needs to add the task-id to the data store so that it can be retrieved later @done(25-11-29 10:46)
    ☐ Add a hover effect when you are hovering over a droppable item
      ☐ This can be simply adding a class when we are over and removing when we leave
      ☐ We can also add a placeholder where it is going to go.
        You can use some of the logic from the KanBan thing
    ✔ The task should be draggable where there is no text and have a drag handle @done(25-11-29 10:49)

    NOTES
      On double-click, you can pull up a dialog to edit the title and description


  Refactor: 
    Refer to the UML diagram in drawio
    ☐ Spend some time writing out the purpose for each class and it's responsibilities. This will help to make the right decisions in the future.

  ☐ Select a task with the arrow keys (once one has already been selected)
  ☐ The last task in the last section should be focused upon page load
  ☐ Move tasks up and down with keyboard controls
      That is, using ctrl+arrow keys
  ☐ Add a confirmation if the task to be deleted contains subtasks (so that the user doesn't accidentally delete a shitload)

Model:

  Task: 
    ☐ Get projects to be serializable

View:

  Tasks:
    ☐ Add the option to center it or to place it on the left side

  Design and Style:
    ☐ Fix the CSS to have background expand with the page - Grid or Flex?
    ☐ Project section on sidebar should stay in place
    ☐ Style the input to not be retarded looking
    ☐ Make the tasks section a fixed width in the page
    ☐ Make the delete button a trash can icon
    ☐ Add a divider between tasks
  DOM:
    ☐ Refactor sections of the site into their respective components, static classes should do
      ☐ Sidebar
        ☐ Projects
        ☐ Options
      ☐ Tasks
        ☐ Heading/Sections

Controller:

  Task:
    ☐ Implement project sidebar with live projects
      ☐ The projects sub-headings need to be based on the sections/headings in the project

    ☐ Implement the ability to add a description
      This means that the task should expand below and allow editing of text

  ✔ Fix tab and shift+tab such that they are correctly placed in task lists @done(25-11-11 15:21) @project(Controller.Task)
    We were making a new task list for every child, instead of only the ones that have kids, and appending it
  ✔ Ability to check off tasks @done(25-11-12 06:39) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Add a checkbox to the tasks @done(25-11-11 13:32) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ When the user clicks the checkbox, it should change the text to be crossed out @done(25-11-11 15:24) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ The underlying Task model should also be complete @done(25-11-11 15:31) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ When re-rendering, complete tasks should have the task-complete added @done(25-11-11 15:31) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Create a View class @done(25-11-02 16:58) @project(View)
    View should host all of the projects and should help in making new DOM elements. May not be neccessary since we are moving much functionality into View and using it to render the page. We'll see. 
  ✔ Create render function that can render all of the task elements from the root element @done(25-11-02 16:58) @project(View)
    I think this can be accomplished by giving all tasks an indent class, starting with indent_0. Then we can pull that number out and use it for the depth calculation. Like, get the parent element depth and start there. Or even include a depth attribute. data.depth; data-depth = 0
  ✔ Rewrite render such that it does all prep, then calls the recursive function on the node provided @done(25-11-02 16:58) @project(View)
  ✔ Make the delete button work again @done(25-11-08 08:45) @project(Controller.Task)
    Turns out that we have to do event delegation with clicks to be able to handle, can't add listener to element since redraws happen
  ✔ Make a new function to handle clicks for page @done(25-11-08 06:59) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Check to see if delete key was clicked @done(25-11-08 06:59) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Find the nearest .task (.closest(".task")); @done(25-11-08 06:59) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Put the focus on another element @done(25-11-08 08:14) @project(Controller.Task)
    We may only want this behavior if there was already a focused task element
  ✔ If the element has a next sibling, use that @done(25-11-08 08:14) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ If it has a previous siblin, use that @done(25-11-08 08:14) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ If it has neither, use the parent element @done(25-11-08 08:14) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ If the parent element is ROOT, use nothing (there are no more tasks) @done(25-11-08 08:14) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Perform the delete operation as normal on the .task @done(25-11-08 08:14) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Make creating a new task focus on that task after it is entered @done(25-11-08 09:01) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ The ability to make a task a sub-task with the tab key @done(25-11-02 16:58) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ We need to implement the renderer to make this match the Tree @done(25-11-02 16:58) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ When a task is made into a sub-task, the element should be refocused @done(25-11-04 15:50) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Before redraw, save the ID of the currently focused task @done(25-11-04 15:50) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ After redraw, find the task that was focused and re-focus it. @done(25-11-04 15:50) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Make shift+tab move a task up the task tree @done(25-11-11 10:45) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Implement looking for shift+tab @done(25-11-11 10:45) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Make delete for parent also delete children @done(25-11-09 15:53) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Add removeNodeByID(root, ID) function @done(25-10-29 15:09) @project(Model.Node)
    Recursively check for the first match and splice it out of the root's children array (ChatGPT)
  ✔ Make the delete button only show upon hovering over the task @done(25-10-27 10:22) @project(View.Design and Style)
  ✔ The ability to select and focus a task @done(25-10-27 10:13) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Create the TaskEventService @done(25-10-29 15:10) @project(Controller.Task)
    This will handle events when the task is the focus. 
  ✔ Get the Tab key hooked up to a listener in the Main class @done(25-10-27 17:07) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Get the Tab key to make the TreeNode of the task jump down to a child of the one above it @done(25-10-31 11:10) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ This should be in a "Task Event Handler" that is given the currently selected task when needed @done(25-10-31 11:10) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Needs to check to make sure that there is a viable parent @done(25-10-31 11:10) @project(Controller.Task)
  ✔ Get the TreeNodes implemented in the Tasks @done(25-10-23 16:03) @project(Model)
  ✔ Add TreeNode to tasks @done(25-10-23 13:15) @project(Model)
  ✔ Add TreeNode data to actual Task definition @done(25-10-23 13:15) @project(Model)
    We are adding TreeNode so that we can begin to perform operations like removing and whatnot
  ✔ Now, we need to start operating from a Root node @done(25-10-23 16:03) @project(Model)
    Later this will be done in a Project class, but for now I think we should just put it in main and 'hardcode' it
  ✔ Add a root TreeNode to main @done(25-10-23 16:02) @project(Model)
  ✔ Now, when adding a task, set the task.node's parent to the 'root' node in main @done(25-10-23 16:02) @project(Model)
  ✔ Add reference to main section @done(25-10-23 13:04) @project(DOM)
  ✔ Make the AddTaskButton actually add an input, but not a new task yet @done(25-10-27 07:05) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Separate adding task functionality from InputHandler function into it's own in main @done(25-10-27 07:08) @project(Controller)
    The AddTaskButton should add an input that disapears when left empty, and adds a tasks when the enter key is pressed or the input is unfocused. This way we can add a cleaner add task function and use it for testing
  ✔ We need to be able to delete the Tasks @done(25-10-27 07:08) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Add a delete button to tasks (DOM); @done(25-10-24 05:37) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Move hanlding the 'blur' event into a different function, or add in separate IF statement for separate logic @done(25-10-24 05:42) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Hook them up to a function in Main for now @done(25-10-25 17:16) @project(Controller)
  ✔ The function should both remove the DOM and remove the TreeNode @done(25-10-25 17:16) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Need to add a remove TreeNode function to TreeService @done(25-10-25 17:16) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Start with just the TreeNode @done(25-10-21 16:30) @project(Model)
  ✔ Create the TreeService @done(25-10-21 16:30) @project(Model)
    This might just basically be what traverse is doing
  ✔ Create a bunch of Unique ToDo items so you can work on displaying items on screen @done(25-10-21 16:30) @project(Model)
  ✔ Change the element class names for the Tasks section to make more sense @done(25-10-23 13:03) @project(View)
  ✔ Add a DOM class @done(25-10-22 11:32) @project(View.DOM)
  ✔ Create a hook for the add task button in Main @done(25-10-21 16:30) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Make the button add a new to-do__item div to the page @done(25-10-21 16:30) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Should contain an input at first @done(25-10-22 11:19) @project(Controller)
  ✔ The input should be used to then change the task. When the input is changed (enter is pressed), then it should change the text of the parent to do element and then remove itself (the input) from the DOM. @done(25-10-22 11:19) @project(Controller)
  ✔ This also means that if the input is empty when the event fires, the whole To Do item should be removed. @done(25-10-22 11:31) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Made the add new task button actually add the input @done(25-10-22 11:32) @project(Controller)
  ✔ Create the Task class in separate module @done(25-10-16 11:03) @project(Model)
  ✔ Import it into the index and test it @done(25-10-16 11:03) @project(Model)
  ✔ Add functional date and time to completion for tasks @done(25-10-16 11:24) @project(Model)
  ✔ Research and test using the date functions @done(25-10-16 11:24) @project(Model)
  ✔ Just make the addChild function first and make sure it works @done(25-10-19 21:41) @project(Model)
  ✔ Then make the setRoot function and make sure that works @done(25-10-19 21:41) @project(Model)
  ✔ Make the Traverse(callback) function and make sure it works (can be used for printing for example) @done(25-10-19 22:06) @project(Model)
  ✔ To test, you can write a function to traverse the tree and print it out with indents (file tree style) @done(25-10-20 09:46) @project(Model)
  ✔ Now add the findByID(id) function @done(25-10-20 17:27) @project(Model)
  ✔ Create the IDService @done(25-10-18 16:24) @project(Model)
  ✔ Start with a simple, non hierarchical ID for tasks. Follow the diagram @done(25-10-16 11:53) @project(Model)
  ✔ Make hierarchical ID (No guardrails though) @done(25-10-16 11:53) @project(Model)
  ✔ Add projectIDs as well @done(25-10-18 16:12) @project(Model)
  ✔ Add function for getting the uniqueID (the last ID is the current object's ID) @done(25-10-18 16:24) @project(Model)
  ✔ Get the basic page layout setup - look to one of the other ToDo apps for inspiration @done(25-10-15 12:16) @project(View)
  ✔ Sidebar @done(25-10-15 11:24) @project(View)
  ✔ Section in page for ToDo items @done(25-10-15 11:37) @project(View)
  ✔ Header for ToDo Items @done(25-10-15 11:40) @project(View)
  ✔ Add section for profile name and other buttons to go @done(25-10-15 12:12) @project(View)
  ✔ Add section in sidebar for projects @done(25-10-15 12:12) @project(View)
  ✔ Just make a single project 'card' to start @done(25-10-15 12:12) @project(View)
    This is because we will eventually have multiple projects here
  ✔ Rewatch the video on designing websites/programs and take notes @done(25-10-14 14:17) @project(View)
  ✔ Create the ToDo items wrapper underneath the header that your code can latch onto @done(25-10-20 20:25) @project(View)
